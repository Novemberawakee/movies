         <p><b>Dom Cobb</b> is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing<br> valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind<br> is at its most vulnerable. <b>Cobb's</b> rare ability has made him a coveted player in this<br> treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international<br> fugitive and <em>cost him everything he has ever loved.</em></p>
         <p>Now <b>Cobb</b> is being offered a chance at redemption. <em>One last job could give him his life<br> back</em> but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist,<br> <b>Cobb</b> and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an<br> idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of<br> careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to<br> predict their every move. An enemy that only <b>Cobb</b> could have seen coming. </p>
